Hi!

Welcome to this ReadMe.

The purpose of this code is to enable automatic deployment of an Azure Firewall, complete with DNAT, NAT and Application rules and the required disks, NSGs, route tables. This demo was built using the following Azure documentation:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal

The purpose of this template is to easily deploy customer demos, without the need to manually provision the resources each time or maintain the resources longer than is required.

Please note, when you run this deployment and are asked to create a username and password, passwords must be at least eight characters long and be made up of three out of these four items: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and symbols.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out via my user page. If you have any suggestions or additions, I'd also love to hear from anyone for collaboration.

Thanks!

Note: this deployment was last successfully deployed on 3/12/2024. If you have any issues with this Template Spec deployment, please reach out and let me know.
